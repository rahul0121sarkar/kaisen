          <p class="text-secondary">In Jujutsu Kaisen, all living beings emanate energy called Cursed Energy (呪力, Juryoku), 
            which arises from negative emotions that naturally flow throughout the body. Ordinary people cannot control this flow in their bodies.
             As a result, they continually lose Cursed Energy, resulting in the birth of Curses (呪い, Noroi), a race of spiritual 
             beings whose primary desire is to bring harm to humanity. These curses are shown as gruesome monsters, ghosts, and yōkais..</p>

          </h2>
          <p class="text-secondary">The appearance of "quirks," newly discovered super powers, has been steadily increasing over the years, with 80 percent of humanity possessing
             various abilities from manipulation of elements to shapeshifting. This leaves the remainder of the world completely powerless, and Izuku Midoriya is one such individual. 
             Since he was a child, the ambitious middle schooler has wanted nothing more than to be a hero. Izuku's unfair fate leaves him admiring heroes and taking notes on them whenever he can.
              But it seems that his persistence has borne some fruit: Izuku meets the number one hero and his personal idol, All Might. All Might's quirk is a unique ability that can be inherited,
               .</p>

            Ego to achieve their dream of winning the World Cup. Believing that Japan has lacked an egoistic striker hungry for goals, Jinpachi initiates the Blue Lock—a prison-like facility
             where three hundred talented strikers from high schools all over Japan are isolated and pitted against each other. The sole survivor of Blue Lock will earn the right to become the
              national team's striker, and those who are defeated shall be banned from joining the team forever. Selected to join this risky project is Yoichi Isagi, a striker who failed to bring 
              his high school soccer team to the national tournament.</p>

      <p>The illusion of animation—as in motion pictures in general—has traditionally been attributed to the persistence
         of vision and later to the phi phenomenon and/or beta movement, but the exact neurological causes are still uncertain. 
         The illusion of motion caused by a rapid succession of images that minimally differ from each other, with unnoticeable
          interruptions, is a stroboscopic effect. While animators traditionally used to draw each part of the movements and changes 
          of figures on transparent cels that could be moved over a separate background, computer animation is usually based on programming 
          paths between key frames to maneuver digitally created figures throughout a digitally created environment.</p>
